This project presents an AI-powered emergency response system designed to detect severe road accidents and automatically send SOS alerts to nearby ambulances and hospitals. The system enhances road safety and emergency response times using smart sensors and intelligent decision-making.
Key Features:

    Automatic Accident Detection:
    Utilizes a pressure sensor to detect airbag deployment or high-impact collisions.

    Instant SOS Trigger:
    Upon detection, the system immediately sends an SOS alert with real-time location to the nearest available ambulance using GPS integration.

    AI-Driven Routing:
    The ambulance is guided to the nearest hospital via AI-based route optimization using Google Maps API or similar services.

    Data Logging and Analytics:
    Accident data, including location, time, and vehicle ID, is automatically stored for analysis and future improvements in urban traffic and emergency infrastructure.

Technologies Used:

    Embedded Systems (Pressure Sensor + Microcontroller)

    AI Algorithms for Route Optimization

    GPS & Location Tracking

    Google Maps API

    Javascript (for server-side logic and automation)

    MySQL for real-time updates

Impact:

This system significantly reduces response time in critical emergencies and provides a fully automated, hands-free approach to saving lives in road accidents â€” especially crucial in scenarios where the victim is unconscious or unable to call for help.
